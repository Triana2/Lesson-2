  <p>Here's some stuff that you should know about me and my family. You'll see a list of what I like to do, what my favorite superhero/anti-hero and what I like to eat. I'll tell you that I do have a Malamute, Husky, German Shepard mix and his name is Kodi. He's a bit lazy well always lazy, but he loves to go on walks or go on adventures which is going on car rides. Either way he's my best friend when I'm home. Kodi likes to annoy my parents and I by wanting to go outside then come back in 5 minutes later then will want to go back outside 5 mintues later, he always wants to go back and forth. Enough about my dog and lets get to the list.</p>

<p>I'd list more heros/anti-heros but the list would be to long. I'm a comic book person like my dad is</p>
